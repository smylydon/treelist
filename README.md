A JavaScript Treelist. 
==========================================

The idea for this code came from great book on data structures using Java. It contained an elegant treelist implementation which I thought would be great to re-write in JavaScript. I decided to used qunit for the unit tests.
At this moment in time the AVL functions are not implemented yet.
